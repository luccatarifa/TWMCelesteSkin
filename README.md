First of all, this is my first custom skin on TWM++ and my first repository on GitHub, so idk how to do this properly, sorry dsfdfsjkl

# Celeste skin for NDSi

This is the custom skin for TWM++ based on my favourite game, Celeste, it includes custom background, icons, color pallete, BGM, sound effects, etc!

3DS version will be made soon! 

# How do i add that skin on my DSi?

- Download the "Celeste DSi skin by liquid_tax" folder, and place it on [sd:/_nds/TWiLightMenu/dsimenu/themes/]
- Go to your DSi where the SD card is inserted, press Select and go to the TWM++ Settings
- On the GUI Settings page, go to the Theme option and choose the theme using the right and left buttons on the D-Pad (Make sure to select "Nintendo DSi"!!)
